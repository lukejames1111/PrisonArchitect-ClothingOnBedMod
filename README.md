# Prison Architect Clothing on Bed Fix

Ever have that issue where prisons clothing need is never getting fulfilled? Well, it's likely because the prisoners can't access the clean clothing as the handymen like to place the clothes on walls where they cannot access it. This is a mod for Prison Architect that changes the game's behavior so that clean clothes are placed on the prisoners' beds, instead of on walls. This ensures that all prisoners can access their clean clothes without any issues.
